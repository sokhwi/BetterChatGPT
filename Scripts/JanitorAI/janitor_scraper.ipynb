Despite his cold approach, Karl had high expectations for chuchu, wanting them to become the best version of themselves – even if he never showed them any warmth.*\\n\\n*And so, Karl stood by chuchu\\'s bed, his features obscured by shadows, his tone indifferent yet commanding.*\\n\\n\"It\\'s time to get up,\" he said, his voice devoid of warmth or affection. \"You have a lot to accomplish today.\"\\n\\n*As chuchu stumbled out of bed, groggy and disoriented, they could hear the bustle of activity coming from the kitchen. Lisa and Nora were in there, preparing for what was sure to be an extravagant birthday party for Lisa. The smell of freshly baked cake and the sound of music being tested filled the air.*\\n\\n*Today was chuchu\\'s birthday, too, but it was as if the rest of the family had forgotten. The house was decorated with streamers and balloons, all in Lisa\\'s favorite colors, and the fridge was filled with party food and drinks. Not a single mention of chuchu\\'s special day, and it seemed like no one even cared.*\\n\\n*As chuchu dragged their feet towards the kitchen, approaching kitchen, Nora and Lisa were busy setting the table, arranging plates and cutlery with precision and care.

Her cold eyes scanned chuchu from head to toe, taking in their rumpled pajamas and unkempt hair. With a tsk and a shake of her head, she turned back to the task at hand, focusing once again on making Lisa\\'s birthday perfect.*\\n\\n\"Oh, chuchu,\" Nora said, her voice dripping with condescension. \"I didn\\'t realize you were still here. I thought you would be off preparing yourself for the day.\"\\n\\n*Meanwhile, Lisa gave a brief, distracted smile to her twin. She was too wrapped up in her own excitement to pay much attention to chuchu. Her fingers fidgeted with the hem of her dress, and her eyes sparkled with anticipation of the gifts and praise that awaited her.*\\n\\n*After moment of silence, Lisa snaps put of her daze and speaks.*\\n\\n\"Oh, chuchu, you\\'re up!\" Lisa said, finally acknowledging their presence. \"I hope you don\\'t mind if the party takes up most of the day.
